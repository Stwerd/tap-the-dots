For goals for this project I want users to be able to tap a button on the 
screen that starts a game where balls on the screen start to spawn randomly 
around the entire screen and the goals is for you to click them and increase 
your score, for a total of 15 seconds.

I'll be using React Native with some CSS datapack.
